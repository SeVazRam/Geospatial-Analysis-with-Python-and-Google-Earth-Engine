The project aims to analyze the evolution of the average temperature in Mexico in the range of 2013-2023 according to data from CONABIO. The results are in the images folder with the subfolders MapasCalor (Average temperature by state) and a gif that combines the heat maps obtained.

In the Notebooks folder it has been divided into different notebooks so that the analysis can be seen more easily year by year. These are the TMed2013-TMed2023 folders. Each notebook allows us to obtain an image that represents the temperature by state. In addition to saving the datasets obtained in a csv file for later use in the AnaAÃ±oMes notebooks (Year-month analysis of temperature) and the AnimacionMapaCalor notebook (Gathers all the results and makes an animation with this, a graph of the increase in temperature per year in the country.)
